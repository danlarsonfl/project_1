Project Title: Comparing Song Danceability, Explicitness, and Popularity Based on Spotify Users' Data

Team Members: Daniel Larson, Phillip Ogborn, Corrie Thomas

Project Description: We will be exploring different Spotify datasets to gain insight on the relationship between danceability, explicitness, and popularity of various artists and songs.

Research Questions to Answer: 
    1. The more popular a song, the more danceable it is.
    2. The more explicit a song, the more danceable.

Datasets to be Used: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data_by_year.csv

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
    1. First we will look at cleaning/merging data.
    2. Run statistical analysis on the cleaned data to prove or disprove our hypothesis.
